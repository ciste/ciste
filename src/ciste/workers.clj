  "Workers are tasks functions that run on their own thread p for a time,
  sleep, and then run again. Generally, tasks that will repeatedly run. A
  worker can be started and stopped by any thread. When a worker is
  stopped, it will continue until the next time that it exits. You can
  check if it's stopping within your code if you wish to exit earlier.
